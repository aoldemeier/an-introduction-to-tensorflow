# an-introduction-to-tensorflow
This repository contains all material for a little introductory talk on TensorFlow.

I held this talk in September 2016 to find about TensorFlow myself. I will continue to work on these slides and hopefully add presentations for more advanced topics.

Please do not hesitate to contact me to discuss anything in this repository.
